<a class=current-section href=https://kerimkaan.github.io/journal/>Make a POS Terminal</a></li><li>30 November 2020</li></ul></subtitle></header><main><p>We use POS systems every day. When you buy eggs from the grocery store, you take out your credit card and hand it over to Uncle Haydar. Your credit card is read on the device and payment is made - sometimes contactless, sometimes by entering your password. Imagine how many customers like you make their payments from different places at the same time every day through POS systems. Banking applications running in the background should be able to handle too many transactions happening at the same time, as well as high security and high stability. For this reason, they are usually written in low-level programming languages ​​such as <code>C, C++</code>. Therefore, the production process and time are quite annoying. However, as these systems are of critical importance, they should not be deviated from the safe path.</p><blockquote><p>The point of sale (POS) or point of purchase (POP) is the time and place where a retail transaction is completed. At the point of sale, the merchant calculates the amount owed by the customer, indicates that amount, may prepare an invoice for the customer (which may be a cash register printout), and indicates the options for the customer to make payment. It is also the point at which a customer makes a payment to the merchant in exchange for goods or after provision of a service. After receiving payment, the merchant may issue a receipt for the transaction, which is usually printed but can also be dispensed with or sent electronically.</p></blockquote><p>Still, new methods are on the agenda, as the technology market is developing and flourishing so fast. The <a href=https://rust-lang.org><code>Rust programming language</code></a> has started to make an impact in the system programming community. There is an expectation that it can replace C and C ++, but we can say that it is still in its infancy. Of course, it cannot replace C and C ++, but we see that they try to take their good sides and throw away the bad ones and bring a new programming approach. New approaches such as ownership, mutability at first reduce the slope of the learning graph of this language. Amateur-level enthusiasts like me write &ldquo;Hello, World&rdquo; applications and examine what can be done next.</p><blockquote><p>The primary distinguishing characteristic of systems programming when compared to application programming is that application programming aims to produce software which provides services to the user directly (e.g. word processor), whereas systems programming aims to produce software and software platforms which provide services to other software, are performance constrained, or both (e.g. operating systems, computational science applications, game engines, industrial automation, and software as a service applications).<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup></p></blockquote><p>We are currently developing an RESTful<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup> API<sup id=fnref:3><a href=#fn:3 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>3</a></sup> with <code>NodeJS</code> and an interface with <code>React</code>. I always like side work and a language combining performance and stability was exactly the address I was looking for. I was thinking of a database connected API development project. The POS system came to my mind in a simple and easy way to learn and design the whole process.</p><p>I entered Github and created a private repo and named it <strong>POSLa</strong>. My goal is to create a fast API. So the journey started.</p><section class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1 role=doc-endnote><p>System programming on Wikipedia <a href=#fnref:1 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:2 role=doc-endnote><p>Representational State Transfer <a href=#fnref:2 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:3 role=doc-endnote><p>Application Programming Interface <a href=#fnref:3 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li></ol></section></main><nav class=prev-and-next><div class=next><p class=hint>What's next?</p><a href=https://kerimkaan.github.io/journal/1/>Part One: Design Principles</a></div><div style=clear:both></div></nav></body></html>
